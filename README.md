# Project Overview

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where I come in.


## The Feed Reader
Over a Google Feed loading API the feeds from several sites are loaded asynchronouisly.  



## Running the Test Suite

* Clone or download the project from Github
* Load the index.html file with the browser
* The tests should be visible after the loaded feeds. 


## References

* [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) - This test used the Jasmin testing framework
